Fine-grained Image Localization


Project Setting:

In this research project, you will develop, evaluate, and analyse a method for fine-grained localisation in a real-world environment. More information about the project can be found in the specification.

Steps:

To accomplish the goal, we first need to know that there are generally two different road towards the goal: traditional computer vision based and deep learning based methods. 


For the Traditional methods, there are generally three stages for the project:

1. key point extraction with feature descriptor.

2. key point matching between train and test set.

3. Camera Calibration and two-view localization for the final output.
