I am currently in my second year doing Master of Computer Science in University of Melbourne, and my research area include point cloud semantic segmentation, synthetic data augmentation, and driving scene perception. I finished my bachelor of Information Technology in Australian National University, majored in Software Development and specialised in Artificial Intelligence.
